Menus
=====
Since it's challenging to save menus out of the WordPress database but not worth hard-coding them into the theme, here's a list of the menus that need to be created assigned to each theme location on a fresh WP install.

- Primary
    + "Introduction" -> Page: Introduction
    + "Interactive Maps" -> Post Type Archive: Maps
    + "Political Narratives" -> Post Type Archive: Narratives

- Secondary
    + "Feedback" -> Page: Feedback
    + "Credits" -> Page: Credits
    + "Bibliography" -> Page: Bibliography

- Introduction
    + "Read About the Project" -> Page: Read About the Project
    + "Intro Video" -> Page: Intro Video
